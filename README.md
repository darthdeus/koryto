# Koryto

> Pronounced like _corrito_, which is pronounced as if you combined _coroutine_ and _burrito_, because everyone knows coroutines are burritos in the category of endofunctors.

Game loop focused async executor for all your coroutine needs. Inspired by [macroquad's experimental coroutines](https://docs.rs/macroquad/latest/macroquad/experimental/coroutines/), [the cosync crate](https://docs.rs/cosync/latest/cosync/), [Unity's amazing coroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine.html), and lastly [Godot's coroutines](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#awaiting-for-signals-or-coroutines) which for a while [weren't true burritos](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/24311).
